What code draws the blades of grass?
: 9-12
What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?

What's the point of the h variable?

What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h)? Why is it there?

With those answers in mind, come up with variations to the program that do the following:
Make the lawnmower come when the grass reaches a pre-determined height. Save this in your homework repository as height-lawnmower.js.

Make it a windy day! Change how the blades of grass are drawn so that they all slant towards the right. Save this in your homework repository as windy-lawnmower.js.
Of course, because this is a computer, you can make the lawnmower come whenever we want. Use the variable mouseIsPressed to make mouse clicks trigger the lawnmower. Save this in your homework repository as clicky-lawnmower.js. (Hint: the mouseIsPressed variable is one that P5 defines for us, and is documented in the P5 reference. It was also used in the Bubbles program in week 1.)
Optional Challenge: Add flowers when the blades of grass reach a certain height. Save this in your homework repository as flowery-lawnmower.js.
Optional Challenge: Right now, the grass just disappears -- animate the lawnmwer coming through and cutting back the grass. (You might need a bunch of extra variables for this! Remember how you animate a shape moving across the screen.) Save this in your homework repository as animated-lawnmower.js.
